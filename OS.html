<h2>Types of Operating Systems </h2>
<p>There are several different types of operating systems: </p>

 
 <h4>Multi-User </h4>
<p> operating systems were originally used on mainframes, arge and expensive computers used mainly by government departments and large companies for high-volume data processing tasks such as censuses, industry/consumer statistics and financial transaction processing. Nowadays they are often used on networked systems.There are several different types of multi-user system:

    <h4>Single Processor</h4>
    
    <p>They have only a single processor or CPU, which is shared between users by dividing the CPU time into time-slices and allocating one of these to each user in turn. The time-slices are very short, giving each user the impression that their programs are running continuously.</p>

<h4> Multiple Processor</h4>
These systems have more than one processor. Users still have to share processors, but performance is improved as there are fewer users per processor. Some supercomputers have thousands of processors running in parallel.
