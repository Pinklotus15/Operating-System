<h2> What is Operating System</h2>


<p style="font:bold 18px/24px Garamond, Georgia, Times, Serif">An operating system or OS is a software on the hard drive that enables the computer hardware to communicate and operate with the computer software. Without a computer operating system, a computer and software programs would be useless. The picture to the right is an example of Microsoft Windows XP, a popular operating system and what the box may look like if you were to purchase it from a local retail store.
</p>
 
 <h2>Types of Operating Systems </h2>


<p style="font:bold 18px/24px Garamond, Georgia, Times, Serif">There are several different types of operating systems:
</p>

<li style="font:bold 18px/24px Garamond, Georgia, Times, Serif">Multi-User
</li> 

<li style="font:bold 18px/24px Garamond, Georgia, Times, Serif">Single Processor
 </li>

<li style="font:bold 18px/24px Garamond, Georgia, Times, Serif">Multiple Processor </li>
 
<li style="font:bold 18px/24px Garamond, Georgia, Times, Serif">Networked Systems </li>

<li style="font:bold 18px/24px Garamond, Georgia, Times, Serif">Multi-Tasking Systems
</li>

<li style="font:bold 18px/24px Garamond, Georgia, Times, Serif">Real Time Systems
</li>


 <h2>Multi-User </h2>

<p style="font:bold 18px/24px Garamond, Georgia, Times, Serif">Operating systems were originally used on mainframes, arge and expensive computers used mainly by government departments and large companies for high-volume data processing tasks such as censuses, industry/consumer statistics and financial transaction processing. Nowadays they are often used on networked systems.

    <h2>Single Processor</h2>
    

<p style="font:bold 18px/24px Garamond, Georgia, Times, Serif">They have only a single processor or CPU, which is shared between users by dividing the CPU time into time-slices and allocating one of these to each user in turn. The time-slices are very short, giving each user the impression that their programs are running continuously.

<h2> Multiple Processor</h2>


<p style="font:bold 18px/24px Garamond, Georgia, Times, Serif">These systems have more than one processor. Users still have to share processors, but performance is improved as there are fewer users per processor. Some supercomputers have thousands of processors running in parallel.

<h2> Networked Systems </h2>


<p style="font:bold 18px/24px Garamond, Georgia, Times, Serif">It consists of single user PCs connected together to form a Local Area Network (LAN). Each PC has a Network Interface Card (NIC) and they are normally connected by means of copper or fibre cables, although wireless networks are becoming increasingly common. Networks allow users to share files and resources such as a printer or an Internet connection. Common network operating systems include Windows NT, Windows 2000/2003 Server and Unix/Linux.

<h2> Multi-Tasking Systems</h2>

<p style="font:bold 18px/24px Garamond, Georgia, Times, Serif">They are thosewhich can carry out several tasks simultaneously, eg: printing a document while carrying out calculations within a spreadsheet. Multi-tasking systems can be single user or multi-user and they can use either pre-emptive multi-tasking, where the OS handles the switching of resources between tasks, or co-operative multi-tasking, where each task relinquishes control at an appropriate stage, eg: while awaiting input from a user.

<h2>Real Time Systems</h2>

<p style="font:bold 18px/24px Garamond, Georgia, Times, Serif">They are those used for direct control over electromechanical equipment such as industrial robots, factory processes, power stations, airplanes, trains and cars. They monitor external events and react instantaneously, hence the expression "real time".
