# Things I have learnt from this activity

These are the three new terminology I was unfamiliar with during this activity.
I learnt about MotherBoards. I discovered that the Motherboard is the PCB that is the name of many of the vital components of the computer. Also it is a printed circuit board containing the principal components of a computer or other device, with connectors into which other circuit boards can be slotted. Also I learned three functionality from Motherboards which consisted of sockets, RAM slots.
I learnt about Network Topology. I never knew anything about this topic and learned about the importance of it to run device. I learned that Network Topology is the schematic description of a network arrangement, connecting various nodes(sender and receiver) through lines of connection. In addition I learned 3 functionally of it such as the bus topology (main cable), star topology (all nodes that are connected to a central server, and tree topology (hybrid).
Finally the last terminology was Output devices. I did not no about this topic before. I learned that it is a output device that obtains data from another machine like a computer or phone. For example headphones.
